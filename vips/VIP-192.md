# Overview

This proposal outlines a signing mechanism which will enable **Applications** asking for **User's** identification or agreement of `Terms of Service` in a secure way. In the decentralized land, **User** which is the private key holder lives in a situation that is much different than before. We proposed **Certificate** in the title that is a more accurate description of it.


# Specification

## Fields

* *purpose* - `string`:  Can be "identification" or "agreement". And the scope will be extended in the future. Application needs to declare it's purpose when it is requesting the user's signature, the user needs to check the content carefully:
    
    | purpose | scenario |
    | --- | --- |
    | identification | Request user's identification which is the proof of holding the private key。In this scenario *payload* is not important to the user. |
    | agreement | Request user's agreement of `Terms of Service`, eg. Privacy Policy etc. |

* *payload* - `object`: The body of the payload
    
    * *type* - `string`: Specify the type of*content*, only "text" is supported now，the scope may be extended in the future.
    * *content* - `string`: The message in the format of *type*. When the *type* is "text", it should be text.

* *timestamp* - `number`: Timestamp in second, same as block timestamp. It could be the contract signing time, so the user should check the timestamp very carefully before signing the request. If there is backend service in your application, the backend needs to check the timestamp make sure it follows your rule.
* *domain* - `string`: Hostname of the application, equals to party A in the contract. Backend service should check this to match the real domain of the application to prevent cross-domain replay attack.
* *signer* - `string`: User account which signed the certificate in the hexadecimal string, starts with '0x'.
* *signature* - `string`: Signature in hexadecimal string, starts with '0x'.

## Encoding

This proposal is totally off-chain, we don't need to care much about the size of the payload. We choose the simple, flexible and general JSON as the format for encoding, to make the result of signing deterministic, we define the following rule: 

1. Key of JSON sorted by alphabet ascending;
2. Encoding should be strict, no indention, no wrap;
3. When it comes to character encoding, `utf-8` should be used;
4. Format of *signer* and *signature* should be hexadecimal string, starts with '0x';

## Hashing

Hashing algorithm should use `blake2b 256bit` which is widely used in VeChain.

## Signing

Signing algorithm should use `secp256k1`. The message for signing is the whole payload without *signature**, encoded with the described method.

## Verification

1. Encode the message and calculate the hash;
2. Recovery the public key by the message hash and signature, then derive the account address;
3. Compare the recovered address with the address in the payload. Note: if comparing them in hexadecimal string format, ignore the case

## Certificate ID

The complete certificate includes a valid *signature* field, encoded the whole certificate and calculate the hash with the encoded certificate then we got the certificate ID.
