# Overview

This proposal outlines the implementation of the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol described in [1]. The goal is to allow blocks of the Thor blockchain to reach BFT finality.

# Specification

## Block

The basic idea is to allow blocks to carry extra finality-related messages so that nodes can update their BFT states once they receive the blocks and reach block finality. There are four messages, each of which is a block id, representing the new-view `nv`, prepare `pp`, pre-commit `pc` and commit `cm` messages, respectively.

```go
type headerBody struct { 
    ...
    nv  thor.Byte32
    pp  thor.Byte32
    pc  thor.Byte32
    cm  thor.Byte32
}
```

## Local Finality State

Each node `u` maintains its own local finality state that can be defined as:

```go
type fState struct {
    nv  thor.Byte32
    pp  thor.Byte32
    pc  thor.Byte32
    cm  thor.Byte32
    fn  thor.Byte32
}
```

where `fn` refers the latest finalized block.

## View

A view is defined as a chain of blocks such that 

* They start with block `b0`,
* Every block's `nv` message equals `id(b0)`,
* It is called a complete view if the total number of non-duplicate leaders and backers is equal or larger than `2f+1` where `f = int((N-1)/3)` and `N` is the total number of authority masternodes. 

```go
type View struct {
    blks    []*Block
}

// Check whether the chain of blocks is a view
func (v *View) isComplete() bool {
    return v.nv() >= 2*f+1
}
// Return the total number of non-duplicate leaders and backers of the blocks in the array
func (v *View) nv() int;
// // Return the total number of non-duplicate leaders and backers of the blocks in the array such that each block b.pp == b.id()
func (v *View) pp(b *Block) int;
// // Return the total number of non-duplicate leaders and backers of the blocks in the array such that each block b.pp == b.id()
func (v *View) pc(b *Block) int;
```
